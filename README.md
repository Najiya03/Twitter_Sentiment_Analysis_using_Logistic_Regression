# Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_using_Logistic_Regression

##  Project Overview
This project performs **Sentiment Analysis on Twitter data** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques.  
The aim is to classify tweets into sentiment categories such as **Positive** or **Negative** based on the text content.

This repository demonstrates a full ML workflow including:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature extraction
- Model training
- Evaluation and analysis

##  Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **NLTK**
- **Scikit-learn**

##  Dataset Source
This project uses the **Sentiment140 dataset** from **Kaggle**:

- **Dataset Name:** Sentiment140  
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140

The dataset consists of 1.6 million tweets labeled as:
- 0: Negative sentiment
- 2: Neutral sentiment
- 4: Positive sentiment

It is used here for educational and research purposes only.

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Import libraries and dataset  
2. Clean and preprocess tweets (remove noise, punctuation, stopwords)  
3. Text vectorization (here, TF-IDF)  
4. Train Logistic Regression model  
5. Evaluate the accuracy  
6. Predict sentiment for new examples
